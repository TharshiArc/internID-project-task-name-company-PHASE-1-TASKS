          <h2>What is Photography ?</h2>
          <p>Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating images by recording light, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film. It is employed in many fields of science, manufacturing (e.g., photolithography), and business, as well as its more direct uses for art, film and video production, recreational purposes, hobby, and mass communication</p>
          <p>The word Photography literally means 'drawing with light', which derives from the Greek photo, meaning light and graph, meaning to draw. Photography is the process of recording an image – a photograph – on lightsensitive film or, in the case of digital photography, via a digital electronic or magnetic memory.</p>

          <h2>Photograph the natural world.</h2>
          <p>If plants, animals or the outdoors interest you, these types of photography might be right for you.</p>

<p>NATURE PHOTOGRAPHY: Get tips for capturing the great outdoors and wildlife photography. With weather to work around and lighting you can’t always control, it’s important to plan ahead and bring the right gear, whether your aim is photos of mountains, trees or deer.</p>

<p>LANDSCAPE PHOTOGRAPHY: Learn more about the timing, lighting and technical challenges of capturing beautiful vistas, dense forests or vast deserts. Get tips from landscape photographers on the necessity of a tripod and which lenses and shutter speeds are best.</p>

<p>ASTROPHOTOGRAPHY: For those who find themselves staring into the night sky in wonder, astrophotography (a form of long exposure photography) is a good photography genre to explore. With tripods and extremely long shutter speeds, you can capture stunning starscapes, time-lapse images and light paintings that show how stars move in the sky as the Earth rotates.</p>

<p>STROM PHOTOGRAPHY: If the sky within our troposphere piques your interest, you can study weather and take incredible photos through lighting and storm photography. The right gear and safety precautions are essential when shooting weather. With patience, practice and the right timing, electrifying pictures are in your future.</p>

<p>PET PHOTOGRAPHY: Get up close and personal with animals and take photos of people’s pets. Animal photography comes with its own special challenges, but preparation and an ability to adapt during a shoot will help you to snap great shots. Plus, learn some post-processing techniques to make photos of dogs and cats with dark fur pop.</p>

<p>MARCO PHOTOGRAPHY: From insects and small birds to extreme close-ups of flowers and fruits, macro photos make the small appear larger than life. These photos can require a macro lens to capture and the plane of focus is very narrow, making a steady workspace essential. But with photography tips and advice from pros, you can investigate this window into a smaller world.</p>

<p>FLOWER PHOTOGRAPHY: For those more interested in flora than fauna, flower photos are a great genre of photography to explore. These passive subjects are a good way for beginners to learn about shallow depth of field, lighting, exposure and other skills. </p>
